A Python program that allows a user to watch the next movie based on recommendation

This is a system that tells a user what movie to watch next based on the word vector similarity of the description of movies.
The Python program is to create a function to return which movies a user would watch if they have watched Planet Hulk with the description
"Will he save their world or destroy it? When the Hulk becomes too dangerous for the Earth, the Illuminati trick Hulk into a shuttle
and launch him into space to a planet where the Hulk can live in peace. Unfortunately, Hulk lands on the plane Sakaar where he is sold 
into slavery and trained as a gladiator."
